# lkhub

I was bored out of my mind looking for a script to use, but really? I just want Anotherlass to have a 4 hour key system.

**Note: I don't know what was going through my head for the code to be so bad like this.**

If you are a user who likes to see menu, use the script below:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoutubeGam/lkhub/main/Anotherlass.lua')();
loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://lkhub.net/s/loader.lua",true))();
```

If you prefer without the menu we also have:

```lua
loadstring(game:HttpGet'https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoutubeGam/lkhub/main/no_key_menu.lua')()
```
